# The-Matrix
A simple discord bot written in python. the current (and only) devolper is me, i might open apps soon!

How to make the bot yours

for 200 iq devolpers, you can skip this part lol

for smol brains, see that weird thing at the bottom that says "client.run" then "you thought dumbass"? replace the "you thought dumbass" part with your discord bot token

if you dont have a token or discord bot, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, then click on "new application" then click on "bot" then click "add bot" then click "copy token" and paste it in.
